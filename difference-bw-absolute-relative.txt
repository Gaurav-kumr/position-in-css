Difference Between Position: Absolute & Relative;


1. Impact on Positions
Absolute= The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).

Relative= The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. The offsets (top, right, bottom, left) shift the element away from its original position.

2. Impact on other elements
Absolute= The element is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it does not affect the position of other elements and other elements do not affect it.

Relative= The element remains in the document flow, so its space is still preserved, and it can affect the layout of other elements around it.

3. Using
Absolute = position:absolute;
Relative = position:relative;
